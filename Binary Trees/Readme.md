<strong><h3>Basic Tree Terminologies:</h3></strong><br/>
<strong>Root:</strong> The root of a tree is the first node of the tree. In the above image, the root node is the node 30.<br/>
<strong>Edge:</strong> An edge is a link connecting any two nodes in the tree. For example, in the above image there is an edge between node 11 and 6.<br/>
<strong>Siblings:</strong> The children nodes of same parents are called siblings of each other. That is, the nodes with same parents are called siblings. In the above tree, nodes 5, 11 and 63 are siblings.<br/>
<strong>Leaf Node:</strong> A node is said to be the leaf node if it has no children. In the above tree, node 15 is one of the leaf node.<br/>
  <strong>Height of a Tree:</strong> Height of a tree is defined as the total number of levels in the tree or the length of the path from the root node to the node present at the last level. The above tree is of height 2.<br/>
